# Cointegration Scanner 2.1

Scan the S&P 500 for statistically significant, *trade-ready* cointegrated pairs in one pass.  
Pulls constituents, downloads prices, runs Engle–Granger with BH-FDR correction, then **refines** survivors using spread stats and mean-reversion speed. Produces a full scan and a ranked, trade-ready list.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Data acquisition:** S&P 500 members (Wikipedia) + Adjusted Close via `yfinance`
- **Data handling:** log prices, intersection alignment, minimum sample filters
- **Candidate prefilter:** absolute correlation with optional **top-K neighbors** per ticker
- **Engle–Granger** cointegration tests (`statsmodels`) with **Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR)**
- **Refinement** of survivors:
  - OLS hedge ratio (β) on log prices (with constant)
  - Spread volatility bounds (**auto-tuned** from survivor distribution)
  - ADF stationarity on residual spread
  - AR(1) half-life filter for mean-reversion speed
- **Adaptive relaxation loop** to reach at least `MIN_PAIRS` while respecting safety floors/ceilings
- Robust downloads (retries, timeouts) and deterministic seed
- Outputs:
  - `pairs_scan_all.csv` — raw cointegration results with p/q values
  - `pairs_trade_ready.csv` — final, ranked list with diagnostics

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit the **Config** block near the top of `cointegration_scanner_2.1.py` to fit your needs.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `START_DATE` / `END_DATE` | `"2024-01-01"` / `None` | Data window (`None` = today). |
| `MAX_TICKERS` | `500` | Cap S&P universe (≤503). |
| `MIN_DAYS` | `180` | Min valid observations per ticker to retain it. |
| `MIN_OVERLAP` | `160` | Minimum overlapping bars per pair (test/refine). |
| `CORR_MIN` | `0.70` | **Prefilter** absolute correlation threshold on log prices. |
| `TOP_K_PER_TICKER` | `25` | Keep only top-K most-correlated neighbors per symbol (set `None` to disable). |
| `EG_TREND` | `"c"` | Engle–Granger trend term: `'c'`, `'ct'`, `'ctt'`, `'nc'`. |
| `EG_MAX_LAG` | `None` | Let statsmodels choose (`autolag="aic"`). |
| `Q_ALPHA` | `0.05` | BH-FDR significance; survivors have `q_value < Q_ALPHA`. |
| `CORR_FILTER` | `0.80` | **Refiner** correlation threshold (stricter than prefilter). |
| `SPREAD_VOL_MIN/MAX` | placeholders | Ignored initially; replaced by **adaptive** bounds from survivors. |
| `ADF_ALPHA` | `0.05` | ADF p-value cutoff on residual spread. |
| `HL_MIN / HL_MAX` | `5 / 120` | AR(1) half-life bounds (bars). |
| `MIN_PAIRS` | `20` | Target number of trade-ready pairs. |
| `MAX_RELAX_STEPS` | `8` | Max adaptive relaxation iterations. |
| Safety rails | see code | Floors/ceilings for corr/ADF/vol/half-life during relaxation. |
| `OUT_ALL` / `OUT_READY` | filenames | Output CSV names. |
| `TIMEOUT` / `RETRIES` | `20 / 3` | HTTP timeout and download retries. |
| `RANDOM_SEED` | `1337` | Deterministic ordering/repro. |

**Tuning tips**
- **Too strict (few/no pairs):** extend `START_DATE`; raise `TOP_K_PER_TICKER`; lower `CORR_MIN`; increase `MAX_RELAX_STEPS`.
- **Too loose (many pairs):** shrink date window; raise `CORR_FILTER`; lower `ADF_CEIL` or `SV_MAX_CEIL`.

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Universe & Data**
   - Scrape S&P 500 tickers from Wikipedia (normalize dots→dashes for Yahoo, e.g., `BRK.B` → `BRK-B`).
   - Download **Adjusted Close** via `yfinance`; drop tickers with `< MIN_DAYS` valid points.
   - Work in **log prices**; align per-pair on intersected dates.

2. **Candidate Prefilter**
   - Compute absolute Pearson correlation on log prices.
   - Keep pairs with `|corr| ≥ CORR_MIN`.
   - Optionally restrict to **top-K neighbors** per ticker to reduce pair count.

3. **Engle–Granger + FDR**
   - Run `statsmodels.tsa.stattools.coint` (trend=`EG_TREND`, `autolag="aic"`).
   - Apply **Benjamini–Hochberg** to p-values → `q_value`; keep `q_value < Q_ALPHA`.

4. **Refinement (Trade-Ready Filters)**
   - OLS regression `y = α + β x` on log prices → **hedge ratio β**.
   - Residual spread `s = y − β x`; compute **std(s)**.
   - **Adaptive spread-vol bounds:** derive from survivors’ spread std (≈ 5–95th pct), then clamp to safety rails.
   - **ADF** stationarity test on `s` (require `adf_p < ADF_ALPHA`).
   - **AR(1) half-life:** estimate on `s`; accept `HL_MIN ≤ hl ≤ HL_MAX`.

5. **Adaptive Relaxation**
   - If results `< MIN_PAIRS`, gently relax thresholds (bounded by floors/ceilings) and re-run the refiner up to `MAX_RELAX_STEPS`. Keep “best so far.”

6. **Ranking**
   - Composite score prioritizes: **low `q_value`**, **high `|corr|`**, **lower `spread_vol`**, and **half-life near the mid-range**.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

- **“No symbols with sufficient data”**  
  Extend the window (`START_DATE` earlier), reduce `MIN_DAYS`, or lower `MAX_TICKERS`.

- **“No testable pairs found”**  
  Lower `CORR_MIN` or set `TOP_K_PER_TICKER=None`. Ensure `MIN_OVERLAP` fits your window.

- **Few/zero trade-ready pairs**  
  Increase `MAX_RELAX_STEPS`, slightly lower `CORR_FILTER`, widen `HL_MIN/HL_MAX`, or allow higher `ADF_ALPHA` (bounded by `ADF_CEIL`). Check the step diagnostics.

- **HTTP/Download errors**  
  Re-run (script retries automatically). If persistent, reduce `MAX_TICKERS` or increase `TIMEOUT`.

## 💡 Notes & Extensions

- **Custom universe:** Replace `get_sp500_symbols()` with a static list/CSV (sectors, ETFs, ADRs).
- **Different frequency:** Resample to weekly/monthly before log transform for slower regimes.
- **Alternate tests:** Consider Johansen, Hurst screens, or Kalman filter hedge ratio.
- **Execution hooks:** After writing `pairs_trade_ready.csv`, trigger your signal engine/report.
